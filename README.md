PG&E Bill Insights
This project aims to provide users with insights into their PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electric Company) bills through interactive visualizations and a chatbot interface. Users can upload their PG&E bills in CSV format and explore various insights about their energy consumption patterns, billing trends, and ways to reduce energy consumption.

Features
Upload CSV Bill: Users can upload their PG&E bills in CSV format to analyze their energy consumption data.

Visualizations: The uploaded data will be processed and visualized using charts, graphs, and other interactive visualizations to provide insights about energy usage, billing patterns, peak usage times, and more.

Chatbot Interface: Users can interact with a chatbot to ask questions and get personalized insights about their bills, ways to reduce energy consumption, energy-saving tips, and recommendations.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js is used to develop the user interface, providing a responsive and interactive experience for users.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js is used to build the backend server to handle file uploads, process data, and serve API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

Database: MySQL is used as the database to store user data, bill information, and chatbot interactions.
